The game features passive income generators like **LateMeal**, **Scanner**, and more‚Äîeach symbolized with custom Princeton-based backgrounds.

   Earn points by clicking on the main area. Watch your Paw Points pile up!
2. **Upgrade Collectors:**  
   Invest your points in collectors (LateMeal, Scanner, etc.) to generate passive income.
3. **Prestige and Power Up:**  
   Reach new thresholds to prestige, resetting your progress but multiplying your earning potential.
4. **Compete with Others:**  
   You're not alone! Your prox is matched up against others in a global leaderboard. See who's earned the most paw points!
